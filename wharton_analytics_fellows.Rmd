## Psychometrics of Sabermetrics

----

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">

#### Overview

Looking for any edge above the competitor, professional sports teams have turned to psychometric and biometric data, in addition to traditional on-field metrics, to analyze player performance. We worked with a Major League Baseball team to analyze how players' psychological data, collected by scouting reports, influence projected WAR.

#### Technical
Data cleaning: tidyverse </br>
Text Mining: textmining, tidytext </br>
Topic Modeling: latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) </br>
Clustering: hierarchical clustering (hclust)

##### Recommendations
Among the psychological constructs mined from text data, Neuroticism and Openness differed most for pitchers and hitters. A new survey tool for mental skills evaluators shifts the focus of evaluation from the individual mindset to team cohesion.

## YouTube Content Trends

----

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-6">

#### Overview

Trending videos on YouTube do not simply increase viewership, they also inspire new content and engagement from creators. With such a large and diverse dataset of videos, product teams rely on unsupervised learning methods to find similar features among trending videos. Using <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new/" target = "_blank"> a large dataset </a> of YouTube videos, we explore trends to guide the marketing team.

#### Technical
Data cleaning: tidyverse </br>
Clustering: kmeans

##### Recommendations
Our algorithm identified three clusters of categories by views and comments: conversation starts, niche blockbusters, and silent movies. These groups guide the product partnernship team to support gaming influencers and encourage the advertising team to attract paid users with new, cross-category videos.
