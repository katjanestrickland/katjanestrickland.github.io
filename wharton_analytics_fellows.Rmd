# Overview



<a href = "https://wca.wharton.upenn.edu/students/analytics-fellows/" target = "_blank"> Wharton Analytics Fellows </a>is a fellowship program that unites graduate and undergraduate students across schools at Penn to consult with companies on analytics solutions for business practice. Samples from projects where I served as a Technical Lead are below.


# MLB


Looking for any edge above the competitor, professional sports teams have now turned to psychometric and biometric data in addition to performance statistics. In this project, we worked with a Major League Baseball team to analyze how players' psychological data collected by scouting reports influence players' projected WAR.


### Technical

Data cleaning: tidyverse </br>
Text Mining: textmining, tidytext </br>
Topic Modeling: latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) </br>
Clustering: hierarchical clustering (hclust)

### Sample

Project in Process


# YouTube


Product teams often hope to better curate content creation based on previously popular products. Here, I build an
unsupervised learning algorithm to find trends in <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new/" target = "_blank"> a large dataset </a> of YouTube videos. Clustering results inform the sales team on pricing strategies for ads, and the product team on content needs. 


### Technical

Data cleaning: tidyverse </br>
Clustering: factoextra

### Sample

Sample code and charts below. See <a href = "https://github.com/katjanewilson/YouTube" target = "_blank"> GitHub repo </a> for full code and analysis.

```{r echo=TRUE, out.width= "100%", fig.align = "center"}
library(tidyverse)
#install.packages("plotly")
library(plotly)
load(file = "data/data1.Rdata")
df <- data %>%
  select(average_comments, average_dislikes,
         average_likes, average_views)

#scale the data
df<- scale(df)
library(factoextra)
distance <- get_dist(df)
plot<- fviz_dist(distance, gradient = list(low = "#00AFBB", mid = "white", high = "#FC4E07"))
plot

#to determine the optimal number of clusters
set.seed(123)

#function to compute total within-cluster sum of square 
wss <- function(k) {
  kmeans(df, k, nstart = 10 )$tot.withinss
}
k.values <- 1:15

# extract wss
wss_values <- map_dbl(k.values, wss)

plot(k.values, wss_values,
     type="b", pch = 19, frame = FALSE, 
     xlab="Number of clusters",
     ylab="Total Sum of Squares")

k2 <- kmeans(df[,(1:3)], centers = 3, nstart = 25)
