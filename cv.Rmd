#### Education

current PhD Student - Quantitative Methods (Penn)- (full funding via Dean's Fellowship)

Masters Degree- Quantitative Methods (UT Austin)- (full funding)

Bachelors Degree- Business (Notre Dame)

#### Research Area

My work focuses on the methodological considerations of 
advanced statistics and analytics, particularly those related to causal inference
and machine learning. For instance, how well do the results of an analysis generalize to a larger
population of interest? How can sampling and stratification approaches improve the robustness of causal inference estimation? What are the applications of causal inference methods for machine learning? 

</br>I am also interested in the practical application of data science and advanced analytics in industry (see Wharton Analytics Fellows).
