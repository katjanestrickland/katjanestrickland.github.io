|Research Area |  |
|:--------|-------:|

My work focuses on the methodological considerations of 
advanced statistics and analytics, particular those related to the use of quantitative methods in applied settings. For instance, how do the results of an analysis on a nonrandom sample generalize to a larger
population of interest? How can sampling and stratification approaches improve inference estimation? Where can applications of causal inference improve machine learning models? 

Prior to pursuing graduate studies, I taught third grade in the Bronx with the <a href="https://nycteachingfellows.org/" target = "_blank">New York City Teaching Fellows</a> and <a href="https://www.kipp.org/kipp-foundation/" target = "_blank">KIPP</a> public charter school network. The four years I spent in the classroom inform much of the applied work in education that I pursue with my doctoral advisor, <a href="https://www.gse.upenn.edu/academics/faculty-directory/chan" target = "_blank">Wendy Chan</a>.

Additionally, I work on analytics consulting and data science projects with the <a href="https://analytics.wharton.upenn.edu/" target = "_blank">Wharton Analytics</a> department.
