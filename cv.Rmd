#### Education

current PhD Student - Quantitative Methods (Penn)- (full funding via Dean's Fellowship)

Masters Degree- Quantitative Methods (UT Austin)

Bachelors Degree- Business (Notre Dame)

#### Research Interests

My work focuses on the methodological considerations of 
advanced statistics and analytics, particularly causal inference
and machine learning. For instance, how do the results of an analysis generalize to a larger
population of interest? How can sampling and stratification approaches improve the rigor and robustness of analytics? I am also interested in the application of data science methods and advanced analytics
for industry use (see Wharton Analytics Fellows).
