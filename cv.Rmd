#### Education

current PhD Student - Quantitative Methods (Penn)- (full funding via Dean's Fellowship)

Masters Degree- Quantitative Methods (UT Austin)

Bachelors Degree- Business (Notre Dame)

#### Research Area

My work focuses on the methodological considerations of 
advanced statistics and analytics, particularly those related to causal inference
and machine learning. For instance, how well do the results of an analysis generalize to a larger
population of interest? What sampling and stratification approaches improve the rigor and robustness of causal inference? In what ways can causal inference methods improve the reliability of machine learning methods? 

</br>I am also interested in the application of data science methods and advanced analytics in industry (see Wharton Analytics Fellows).
