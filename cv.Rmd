|:--------|-------:|

My work focuses on the methodological considerations of 
advanced statistics and analytics, particularly those related to the use of causal inference
and machine learning in applied settings. For instance, how do the results of an analysis on a nonrandom sample generalize to a larger
population of interest? How can sampling and stratification approaches improve causal inference estimation? What are the applications of causal inference methods for machine learning? 

Prior to pursuing graduate studies, I taught public school in the Bronx with the <a href="https://nycteachingfellows.org/" target = "_blank">New York City Teaching Fellows</a>. The four years I spent in the classroom inform much of the applied work in education I pursue with my doctoral advisor, <a href="https://www.gse.upenn.edu/academics/faculty-directory/chan" target = "_blank">Wendy Chan</a>.

Additionally, I work on applied analytics consulting projects in business settings closely with the <a href="https://analytics.wharton.upenn.edu/" target = "_blank">Wharton Analytics department</a>.
