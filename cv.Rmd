#### Education

current PhD Student - Quantitative Methods (Penn)- (full funding via Dean's Fellowship)

Masters Degree- Quantitative Methods (UT Austin)- (full funding)

Bachelors Degree- Business (Notre Dame)

#### Research Area

My work focuses on the methodological considerations of 
advanced statistics and analytics, particularly those related to the use of causal inference
and machine learning in applied settings. For instance, how do the results of an analysis on a nonrandom sample generalize to a larger
population of interest? How can sampling and stratification approaches improve the causal inference estimation? What are the applications of causal inference methods for machine learning? 

</br>Additionally, I use applied statistics and advanced analytics to work on business problems in industry settings (see Wharton Analytics Fellows).
