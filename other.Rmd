#### Music

I certainly miss playing drums back in Austin, TX, but am happy that I have found some talented musicians to play with in Philadelphia. Check out our <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/user-77041470" target = "_blank"> SoundCloud</a>, or catch us playing at Rittenhouse Park.


#### Art 

<a href = "http://www.skyfruits.org/" target = "_blank">SkyFruits </a> is a tongue-in-cheek, crowdsourced art project that, as things tend to do, later took on a life of its own.
