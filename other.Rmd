<i >Somewhere in the space between cosmic freedom and a responsibility towards the people you love and who love you lies the answer to life. The guitar is a good place to go in search of it. </i>

While I certainly miss the days of playing in a band in Austin, TX, I am lucky to have found some talented musicians to play with in Philadelphia. Check out our songs on <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/user-77041470" target = "_blank"> SoundCloud</a>, or catch us playing most weekends at Rittenhouse Park.
