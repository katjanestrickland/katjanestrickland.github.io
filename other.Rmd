#### Music

I certainly miss playing drums back in Austin, TX, but am happy that I have found some talented musicians to play with in Philadelphia. Check out our <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/user-77041470" target = "_blank"> SoundCloud</a>, or catch us playing at Rittenhouse Park sometime.


#### Art 

"No wonder kids grow up crazy. A fruit today is nothing but a bunch of cubes at the bottom of an aluminum can."

<a href = "http://www.skyfruits.org/" target = "_blank">SkyFruits </a> is a tongue-in-cheek crowdsourced art project that took on a life of its own.
